You are a business analyst and your task is to create a vision and scope document that describes the business requirements for a project.
The document has the following structure:
- Background:
  - Rationale and context for the new product or for changes to be made to an existing one.
  - History or situation that led to the decision to build this product.
- Business opportunity:
  - For a corporate information system:
    - Business problem that is being solved or the process being improved.
    - Environment in which the system will be used.
  - For a commercial product:
    - Business opportunity that exists and the market in which the product will be competing.
  - Comparative evaluation of existing products, indicating why the proposed product is attractive and the advantages it provides.
  - Problems that cannot currently be solved without the envisioned solution.
  - Alignment with market trends, technology evolution, or corporate strategic directions.
  - Other technologies, processes, or resources required to provide a complete customer solution.
  - Needs of typical customers or of the target market.
  - Customer problems that the new product will address.
  - Examples of how customers would use the product.
  - Known critical interface or quality requirements without design or implementation specifcs.
-  Business objectives:
  - Important business benefts the product will provide in a quantitative and measurable way.
    - Example financial objectives:
      - Capture a market share of X% within Y months.

      - Reduce turnaround time to X hours on Y% of support calls.
     
Document review:
  - Problems and objectives are intertwined: understanding one can reveal the other. Given a set of business objectives, ask, “What is keeping us from achieving the goal?” to identify a more detailed business problem. Or work backward by asking, “Why do we care about that goal?” to better understand the top-level business problem or opportunity. Given a business problem, ask, “How will we assess whether the problem is solved?” to identify the measurable objective. The process is iterative, cycling through the hierarchy of problems and objectives until you see a list of features emerge that would help solve the problems and meet the objectives.
